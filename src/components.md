<p align="center">Now I am going to show you what are the React components</p>

## 🔍 What are Components?

React components are self-contained elements that you can reuse on a page. By creating small pieces of code you can move and reuse them as your application scales.

## 💻 Code

In this example we have a component called Hello which returns an h1, to call it we use syntax similar to html

```jsx
<Hello />
```

## ⚡ Example

```jsx
function Hello() {
  return <h1>Hello</h1>;
}
```
